# module-3-password-generator

## Description

This project is a simple password generator that uses Javascript to randomize strings of characters chosen by user input into a password, and places it into a textbox.

By completing this project, I learned more about writing code in Javascript.  I learned about EventListeners, inputting text into an html textarea, as well as gained a better understanding of writing the functions. I focused on one piece of the code at a time, and used console.log statements to prove that the code was working along the way.  After drafting the if statements on paper, I wrote them all into the code, then commented them out until I had the rest of the code written to put the password into the text area.  I then added each line of the logic (one at a time), and confirmed proper operation before moving on.  This allowed me to see that an additional alert window would be helpful, and so I created another issue, and added that alert. It is exciting to start to see how the Javascript can add interaction to the web page!

## Usage

To start the generator, click on the red Generate Password button.  Follow the prompts to add the character sets you would like included in your password, and the resulting password will be posted in the textarea.
